On-Board Diagnostics is a generic term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability.  There are a number of standard interfaces, including OBD, EOBD, and JOBD.  This project focuses on using ODB-II in order to monitor and record data from a car computer at a lower cost than currently available solutions.

odbii-monitor is being written as a group project for the Fall 2010 semester.
